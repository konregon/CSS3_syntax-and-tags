        1.External CSS:- create css file outside and insert that into html doc via <script> tag.
        2.Internal CSS:- inside <head> section with <style> tag.
        3.Inline CSS:- to stylize any individual tag, does not require any spacial tag.

/* 3. Syntax
    any CSS syntax comprised of selector and declaration block
    selector targets the elements we want to style,
    declaration block is warped in { }
        in that we have css declarations
        Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
        for example, width: 200px;
